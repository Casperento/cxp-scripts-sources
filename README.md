# CXP SCRIPTS official repository

This repository contains all of my private script packages made for ![Altis Life Framework](https://github.com/AsYetUntitled/Framework) (v5.0.0).

Feel free to download and use them. I will keep updating them as far as possible.

These systems were once sold in a marketplace. So, if you wanna use them in your server, you need to setup my ![Package Installation Framework](https://github.com/Casperento/cxp-scripts-sources/blob/main/cxp/README.md). Finally, you're ready to install any of the existent script packages.
